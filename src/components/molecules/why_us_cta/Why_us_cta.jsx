				<p>Greek Yogurt is healthier than regular yogurt.</p>
				<p>
					It's high in protein and low in sugar, which makes it perfect for
					breakfast, lunch, or dinner! Greek yogurt is made by straining out the
					whey from regular yogurt. This results in a thicker, creamier product
					that's higher in protein and lower in sugar than regular yogurt. Greek
					yogurt is also much more versatile than regular yogurt. It can be used
					in a variety of recipes, from breakfast dishes to desserts.
